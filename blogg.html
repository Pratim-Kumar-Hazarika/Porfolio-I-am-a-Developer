                    concepts. The fetch concept plays a important role here. It has querySelectors, clickEvents,

                <h1>Portfolio Blog</h1>
                <p>So Learnt to make a cool portfolio. Technologies I have used are 
                    CSS3,HTML5. Thats all yesss Thats all. I have hosted it through
                    netlify and I am availabe for internships just ping me up on my
                    linkedin. 
                    <p>My views on CSS and HTML is that just keep trying it is easy
                        and it doesn't need that much knowlege anyone can do it.
                        But yess it is not that easy don't take it lihghtly but things become
                        easy when you give your best.
                        
                    </p>
                    <small>Thats is it for the portfolio. I will create good blogs in the coming
                        days bare with me.  </small>
                </p>

                <h1>Movie Quiz App Blog</h1>
               <p>So yes this is the Movie App. It has some crazy dialouges .But 
                mostly it containes more of sobs dialouges. So sobs means sad ok. Yeah lol
                I learnt from a friend of mine and since that day I am using "SOBS". Like it is a
                cool word. SAD=SOBS. Sorry that was really bad. But You learnt a new word sobs.
                So now when you say you are sobs. Which means you are sad Ok.</p> 

                <p>So the Technologies are mainly full NodeJS. I have used the CHALK 
                    pacakage also. It likes give some style to you app. It is GG .
                    But I will prefer css it is like more easy to me. But both in their own 
                    place are GG.

                </p>

            <div class="container container-center">
                <h1>Quiz App Blog</h1>
               
                <p> So this app is mostly about how much my friends know me. If anyone
                    scored full . Congrats üòÅ you are a true friend. Ok I am very bad in writing
                    blogs but I will be good in the coming days. </p>
                    <p> So NodeJS is used to make the full app.Try making a app.
