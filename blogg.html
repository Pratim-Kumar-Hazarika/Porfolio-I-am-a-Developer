            <p>Ever wondered how the world of programming works? If the answer is no you are in the
                right place. To someone who never coded before, the concept of creating a website
                may seem really intimidating. But you actually can make anything by learning programming.</p>

              <p>Anyone can do coding just like anyone can learn a new language.Programming is kind of
                like speaking a language which the computer will understand. So there are languages
                out there for the computer which one can learn. Each one has its own rules and syntax
                 that need to be learned in a proper step by step order. Those rules are ways to tell your 
                computer what to do.The goal of this blog is to teach you the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript which is the
                programming language. But first of all let us know what is meant by programming.
                
                </p>  

                <p>Programming language is a way of communicating with software. The people who are using
                    programming language is often called programmers or developers. It is like making 
                    a webpage to look it a certain way or to make a object which will move if someone
                    clicks on it. </p>
                <p>
                    So let's begin with HTML and CSS. HTML and CSS are not technically a programming 
                    language; they are used for structuring and giving style to a webpage. So what is HTML?
                    HTML stands for "Hypertext Markup Language".It is the core of every webpage.It is an
                    essential skill for web developers out there.Html provides the basic structure of sites.
                    It is quite easy to learn also.Anyone willing to learn HTML can learn easily through
                    youtube and there are resources available nowadays everywhere.
                 </p>

                 <p>
                    Html contains tags also known as "elements". These tags have preety intuitive names:
                    Header tags, paragraph tags, image tags, and so on. Every web page is made up of
                    bunch of these HTML tags denoting each type of content of the page.Each type of content
                    on the page is "wrapped" in i.e surrounded by HTML tags.So enough of
                    HTML lets move on to CSS.
                 </p>

                 <p>
                    CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets".It basically tells how the HTML elements will
                    appear on the frontend of the page.In simple words "CSS" gives the styling part. It gives
                    the colour, the size which will make a page look more interactfull.If HTML is a wall,
                    Css is the paint which will be applied on the wall.HTML is the basic structure of the
                    website,CSS is what gives your entire website its style. Those cool colors, interesting 
                    fonts and bakcground images all thanks to Css.So now you got the basic understanding
                    of HTML and CSS. Let's now move on to "JAVASCRIPT".
                    
                 </p>

                 <p>
                    Javascript is more complicated language than HTML and CSS.It requires proper undersatanding of
                    concepts and syntax to make it work. Nowadays, JavaScript is supported by all modern
                    web browsers and is used almost in every site on the web for powerfull and complex
                    functionallity.
                 </p>

                 <p>So let's understand why is JavaScript is used for.It is a logic-based programming 
                    language that can be used to modify a website and to make the website response when a
                    user click on the page. In short, JavaScript is a programming language that lets web
                    developers design interactive sites.Javascript includes making check forms, animations,
                    special effects and many more things. </p>

                    <p>So the hardest part is getting started. But once you start coding and learn the basics, it'll
                        be easier to learn more advanced languages. Like React, angular all these are frameworks.So
                        keep coding!!
                        Trust me, you'll enjoy it.</p>
